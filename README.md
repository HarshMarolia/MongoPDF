# MongoPDF

This project showcases a seamless integration of a React application with Vite for the frontend and a Node.js and Express backend for handling PDF uploads and retrievals, stored in MongoDB.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

### 1. Frontend

The `frontend` folder contains the Vite React application. This modern frontend setup provides a fast development environment and efficient production builds.

#### How to Run the Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and follow these steps:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

This will launch the Vite development server, and you can access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5173.

### 1. Backend

The backend folder houses the Node.js and Express server responsible for handling PDF uploads and retrievals. MongoDB is utilized for storing the PDF files.

#### How to Run the Backend

Navigate back to the `root` folder and follow these steps:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the backend server
npm start
```

The backend server will be running on http://localhost:3000.
